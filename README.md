# Motif Discovery in Timeseries Application

This repository contains an application for motif discovery in timeseries data, implemented in R language. Additionally, it demonstrates the use of Web Assembly to leverage R as a JavaScript library, enabling the execution of R scripts directly in JavaScript. The visualization of results is achieved using D3.js for interactive charts in JavaScript.

## Features

- **Motif Discovery**: Identify recurring patterns (motifs) within timeseries data.
- **R Integration with JavaScript**: Utilize R functionalities within JavaScript via Web Assembly.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Visualize timeseries data and motif discovery results using D3.js.

## Requirements

- R (version X.X.X)
- Web Assembly compatible browser

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git

2. Install necessary R packages. For example:
   ```bash
   install.packages("package_name")

4. Host the project on a local or remote server to run the Web Assembly and JavaScript components.

## Usage
1. Modify the R script (motif_discovery.R) to customize motif discovery parameters or input data.
2. Build the Web Assembly file (r_wasm.wasm) using the provided instructions (if applicable).
3. Integrate and execute the R script in your JavaScript application (app.js).
4. View the interactive charts generated using D3.js in the browser.

## Example
To run the example:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
2. Open index.html in a Web Assembly compatible browser.
3. Follow on-screen instructions to execute the motif discovery and view results.
